# titanicML
Exploratory data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict survival on the titanic ship

*PYTHON DATA MANIPULATION*
This is a CT7201 class assessment that focuses on data manipulation, exploration, analysis, machine learning models and prediction on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle using python as the primary programming language completed in a Jupyter notebook. The result is using machine learning to create a model that predicts which group of passengers survived the infamous Titanic shipwreck. 
Files Included Within This Project 
• Titanic.csv 
• Assignment.ipynb

Libraries Used Within This Project Pandas This is a python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures built to make working with relational data intuitive [1] Uses within the Project This was used to • Load, merge, join and reshape the Titanic csv file data set • Handle missing data (represented as NaN) in floating point as well as non-floating point data. • Aggregate and transform data by using the group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine operations on the data set. NumPy This is a python library that provides a multidimensional array objects, matrices and an assortment of routines such as mathematical, logical, shape manipulation for fast operations on arrays[2]. Uses within the Project • Random simulation/generation on the data set. Matplotlib A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python[3] Uses within the Project • Visualize the data exploratory analysis on age, passenger class and ports embarked within the Titanic dataset.

Seaborn A library built on top of Matplotlib and integrates closely with Pandas data structure which helps to explore and understand the data set through visualization[4]. Its plotting functions operates on data frames and arrays containing whole datasets and internally perform the necessary semantic mapping to produce informative plots. Uses within the Project • Visualize and plot the timeline of events on the titanic voyage and data exploratory analysis on age, passenger class and ports embarked within the Titanic dataset. Scikit-learn This is a machine learning library for the python programming language for predictive data analysis built on NumPy and Matplotlib[5] Uses within the Project • Leveraged on its classifications, regression, and clustering algorithms to predict which passengers survived the titanic shipwreck

*SETUP TASK*
• Creation of the environment
• Imported the dataset using the Pandas library 
• Imported the libraries used for exploration and machine learning such as Pandas, NumPy and scikit-learn

*DATASET*
The data set used for this project it’s the titanic onboarding dataset which includes passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, port of onboarding and it can be obtained by pasting this url - ( https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data ) on a web browser.
